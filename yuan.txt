Inside a space resembling a train carriage, there is a restaurant with a bar. Everyone is busy - cleaning utensils, wiping tables, serving food, and maintaining hygiene. Among them is a foreign woman with curly hair and blue eyes. She takes a deep breath and walks slowly towards the front door, as if making a significant decision. Glancing back, she deeply observes everyone and everything, seemingly trying to etch the ordinary scenes into her memory. Despite her reflection, everyone and everything continues to move at the usual pace without any change. The woman turns again, determined, and presses the silver handle.

Suddenly, she finds herself in a world she has lived in for many years. The place remains scarred by the aftermath of war. Walking on the streets, the woman looks paler than she did in the bustling restaurant world. Her head is wrapped in cloth, making it hard to tell if she lost hair or for some other reason. She appears as if she's on a routine grocery run, wearing a plain expression.

The woman heads back to the restaurant, opens the door, and, in the blink of an eye, seamlessly integrates into the busy restaurant scene. She is seen busily serving guests, dressed in a dark velvet dress and a dark hat, as if this has always been her way of life.

Upon another glance, she's heading towards the door on the other end. From a distance, it's unclear whether she took a 
deep breath this time. It's too far to be certain, but she naturally pauses slightly before heading towards that door, pressing the handle, and entering yet another world.
